# ü™ê ‚öõÔ∏è Jupyter UI

> [React.js](https://reactjs.org) components that allow a frontend developer to build data products compatible with the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) ecosystem. The user interface delivers executable notebooks and cells.

<p>
Many users are reporting issues with their environment (build failures...). This is inherent to the mixed Python/JavaScript environment and dependcy on Jupyter toolchain. We are putting this issue at the <b>top of our priority</b> to ease your pain.
</p>

1. We have just migrated to `yarn v3` to align with JupyterLab 4 and latest `lerna`.
2. We are offering `hosted kernels` so you don't need to run your local Jupyter Server. If you run `yarn start`, you will consume those hosted kernels from the cloud.
3. We are looking towards `pyodide` kernels (already supported for the Console component).
4. The default build should be `faster` and not build the examples, please give your opinion on https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-ui/issues/63.
5. `Docker` and `devcontainer` are options we are investigating, please comment on https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-ui/issues/61.

As a developer start with the [setup of your environment](https://jupyter-ui.datalayer.tech/docs/welcome/develop) and try [one of the examples](https://jupyter-ui.datalayer.tech/docs/category/examples). We have [documentation](https://jupyter-ui.datalayer.tech) for more details.

You can try a simple example on this [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/jupyter-react-cra-example-zygjbm?file=%2Fsrc%2Findex.tsx).

The above image shows a gallery of the available React.js components ready to be used in you custom application. These open source components are used to build [Datalayer](https://datalayer.io), a collaborative platform for data analysis.

## Why?

The Jupyter(Lab) notebook is a tool that allows data scientist to analyse dataset. However, it is not easy to create a custom user interface integrated in an existing application. [Jupyter UI](https://jupyter-ui.datalayer.tech), an open-source library, fills that gap and provides components that a developer can easily integrate in any React.js application.

The Jupyter(Lab) user interface is built on top of Lumino widget toolkit, an imperative way to build user interface and **can not** be consumed by industry standard declarative frameworks like React.js. As a user interface developer, if you want to create a custom data product on top of Jupyter, you have to stick to Lumino and carry-on the full notebook interface not tailored to your specific needs. This is not what you want. You just want to expose what you need, you want to develop with your favorite toolkit (like React.js) and you also want to integrate on a per-component basis the Jupyter functionality in your application.

We also aim removing the rigidity of the extension system and favor [composition over inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance).

IPyWidgets are supported (the Comm feature needs to be fixed). JupyterLite and PyScript support is on the roadmap. Autocompletion is also available.

You can find more context reading this [abstract](https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/lt_jupyter) of the talk given at [FOSDEM 2022](https://fosdem.org/2022) ([video recording](http://bofh.nikhef.nl/events/FOSDEM/2022/L.lightningtalks/lt_jupyter.webm)).

## Next.js Integration

See the [Next.js example](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-ui/tree/main/examples/next-js).

## Docusaurus Integration

We maintain a plugin for [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) in the [docusaurus](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-ui/tree/main/packages/docusaurus-plugin) package folder (see the [Docusaurus example](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-ui/tree/main/examples/docusaurus)).
