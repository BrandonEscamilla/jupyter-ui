As an application developer, you may already have a Redux store. You can simply inject the Jupyter UI store in your own store. JupyterLab/Lumino is heavily built on top of factories. Jupyter UI uses those to create the ad-hoc widgets.

This is what it takes to create a Notebook.

```jsx
<Jupyter terminals={true} collaborative={true}>
  <Notebook path="test.ipynb"/>
</Jupyter>
```

```js
export type INotebookProps = {
  path: string;
  ipywidgets?: 'classic' | 'modern';
  sidebarComponent: (props: any) => JSX.Element;
  sidebarMargin: number;
}
```

Upon the Notebook component, you can also use the Cell, Notebook, Filemanager and Terminal components.
