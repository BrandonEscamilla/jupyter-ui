# Traitlets React

As part of the jupyter-ui components, we also want to ease the creation of user interfaces based on the [Jupyter Traitlets](https://traitlets.readthedocs.io).

This will allow a front-end developer to start from the traits (configuration definition) defined in Python code and automatically generate a React.js user interface which can be used to manage your settings in a visual way.

The traits would be converted to json-schema definitions that can be used to create the React.js components. This is particularly useful to build management user interfaces.

For now the development is done in the Jupyer Manager repository https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-manager for convenience and will move back in the Jupyter UI repository https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-ui as soon as possible.
