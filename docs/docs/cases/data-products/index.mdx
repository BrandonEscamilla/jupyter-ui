# ✍️ Data Products

Jupyter UI provides the foundations to build a modern and flexible data analysis user interface. Underneath, it gathers the minimum set of [Lumino](https://github.com/jupyterlab/lumino) and [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) technologies. We wrap Lumino Widget in a React.js component and expose Redux Observables actions that proxy Lumino Commands. We bind Redux Observables Epics to Lumino Signals. Those bindings convert Lumino Signals to Observable to run the needed actions in the [Observable Epics](https://redux-observable.js.org/docs/basics/Epics.html).

- Services to connect to kernels.
- Extension injection system.
- Lumino signals and messages integrated with Redux.
- Lumino commands.

Jupyter UI components removes the above second limitation and supports:

- Predefined Redux actions, epics and reducers with [Observable Epics](https://redux-observable.js.org/docs/basics/Epics.html)
- Everything is created in a single React tree to ensure Jupyter UI components can use any context created by the host application.
- IpyWidgets and Panel interactive widgets are supported.
- Collaborative RTC is also supported.
- Plays nice with Jupyter Auth, Jupyterpool, Primer React, Material-UI , Storybook, Docusaurus, Emotion.js... and many other standard libraries.
- A React.js context for Authentication, Authorization, Theming and Redux injectable store.
- Benefits from current and new JupyterLab development, eg edit mode navigation, colored-collapser, collaborative cursor.
- Authentication via Jupyter tokens.
- Theming.
- Terminals.

Jupyter UI ensure React.js is a first-class citizen in the Jupyter:

- [Components](/docs/category/components): JupyterLab visual as React.js components
- [Integrations](/docs/category/integrations): Embed Jupyter in Docusaurus.
- [Themes](/docs/category/themes): Themes for your data analysis.

You can get kick-started with simple [examples](/docs/category/examples)

Jupyter UI allows you to build a better Jupyter experience. It adds value to the current existing ecosystem, by alphabetical order:

- [x] Accessible.
- [x] Collaborative.
- [x] Performant.
- [x] Reproducible.
- [x] Reusable.
- [x] Scalable.
- [x] Secured.
- [x] Shareable.
