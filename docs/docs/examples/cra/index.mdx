# Create React Application Example

The example can be found in the [jupyter-react-cra-example repository](https://github.com/datalayer-examples/jupyter-react-cra-example).

## Environment

Setup your [development environement](/docs/welcome/develop).

## Create your own create-react-app (version 5)

You can create your own WEB application and add the Jupyter React dependency.

```bash
npx create-react-app jupyter-react-example --template typescript && \
  cd jupyter-react-example && \
  yarn add @datalayer/jupyter-react
```

Once this is done, double-check the following requirements (just checkout this repository for a complete setup).

### Startup Scripts

You will need a Jupyter server up-and-running. We ship the configuration and scripts in this repository. You can add in your `package.json` the needed definitions.

```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "run-p -c start:*",
    "start:jupyter": "make start-jupyter-server",
    "start:react": "react-scripts start",
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "npm-run-all": "4.1.5",
  },
```

### Dot Env

It looks like the `create-react-app` version 5 does not like sourcemaps pointing to non existing source code. To avoid error messages, please create a `.env` file at the top of your folder/repositoriy and add there `GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false`.

```dotenv
// .env
GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false
```

### Metadata

You need to add in the `public/index.html` the needed information to indicate where you Jupyter server is running.

```html
    <script id="datalayer-config-data" type="application/json">
      {
        "jupyterServerHttpUrl": "http://localhost:8686/api/jupyter",
        "jupyterServerWsUrl": "ws://localhost:8686/api/jupyter",
        "jupyterToken": "60c1661cc408f978c309d04157af55c9588ff9557c9380e4fb50785750703da6"
      }
    </script>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/require.js/2.3.4/require.min.js"></script>
```

### Resolutions

A `create-react-app` requests coherent React.js versions othewise you may hit the `Invalid Hook Call Warning` with `mismatching versions of React and React DOM` as documented on [this page](https://reactjs.org/warnings/invalid-hook-call-warning.html).

With JupyterLab, we are pulling various version in the node_modules subfolders. To avoid version conflicts, set the `dependencies` and `resolutions` in `package.json` to explicitely specificy the needed versions.

JupyerLab is actively developed. We are tracking the latest releases as closely as possible.

Therefor, for now, we ask to pin the yarn resolutions. Add [this block](https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-ui/blob/bbc8df3f9415d511aa239477cf41687bc13a97be/package.json#L70-L175) in your package.json.


## Add MUI dependencies

This example uses Material UI. You can add for example in package.json the following dependencies.

```json
    "@emotion/react": "11.4.0",
    "@emotion/styled": "11.3.0",
    "@mui/material": "5.8.3",
    "@mui/icons-material": "5.8.3",
    "@mui/lab": "5.0.0-alpha.85",
    "@mui/styles": "5.8.3",
    "@mui/system": "5.8.3",
```

## Strict Mode

We don't fully support yet React [Strict Mode](https://reactjs.org/docs/strict-mode.html) (can be useful in development mode). Please remove any reference of `StrictMode` in your source.
