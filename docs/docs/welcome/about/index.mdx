# 🪐 ⚛️ About Jupyter React

> Jupyter React is a set of [React.js](https://reactjs.org) components that allow a frontend developer to build data products compatible with the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) ecosystem. The user interface delivers executable notebooks and cells.

The Jupyter(Lab) Notebook is a tool that allows data scientist to analyse dataset. However, it is not easy to create a custom user interface integrated in an existing application. [Jupyter React](https://jupyter-react.datalayer.tech), an open-source library, fills that gap and provides components that a developer can easily integrate in any React.js application.

In terms of technical stack, the Jupyter(Lab) user interface is built on top of Lumino, which is an imperative way to build user interface and **can not** be consumed by industry standard declarative frameworks like React.js. As a user interface developer, if you want to create a custom data product on top of Jupyter, you have to stick to Lumino and carry-on the full notebook interface not tailored to your specific needs. This is not what you want. You just want to expose what you need, you want to develop with your favorite toolkit (like React.js) and you also want to integrate on a per-component basis the Jupyter functionality in your application.

[JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) is built on the [Lumino](https://github.com/jupyterlab/lumino) widget toolkit.

1. Lumino allows to wrap React components and expose them as Lumino Widgets.
2. React.js **can not** use Lumino Widgets.

Although a developer can embed a React.js component into JupyterLab, the reverse is not possible: you can not embed JupyterLab into a React.js application. To solve that issue, Jupyter-React ships components to easily create a React.js data product compatible with the Jupyter ecosystem. Those components can be used in any React.js application, and also in static websites like Docusaurus, Next.js or Remix. They wrap underneath the JupyterLab code and allow developing React.js applications with code execution capability. State management is based on Redux, and Mobx is to be added.

IPyWidgets are supported (the Comm feature needs to be fixed). JupyterLite and PyScript support is on the roadmap. Autocompletion is also available.

You can find more context reading this [abstract](https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/lt_jupyter) of the talk given at [FOSDEM 2022](https://fosdem.org/2022) ([video recording](http://bofh.nikhef.nl/events/FOSDEM/2022/L.lightningtalks/lt_jupyter.webm)).

The below image shows a gallery of the available React.js components ready to be used in you custom application. These open source components are used to build the online [Datalayer service](https://datalayer.io), a collaborative platform for data analysis.

The Jupyter React components expose JupyterLab visuals as React.js components. It offers a bi-directional communication between React.js/Redux and JupyterLab/Lumino.

```
Host application -> Redux Observable Actions -> Jupyter React -> JupyterLab Commands
Host application <- Redux State  <- Redux Observable Epics <- Jupyter React <- JupyterLab Signals
```

Jupyter React provides the foundations to build a modern and flexible data analysis user interface. Underneath, it gathers the minimum set of [Lumino](https://github.com/jupyterlab/lumino) and [JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) technologies. We wrap Lumino Widget in a React.js component and expose Redux Observables actions that proxy Lumino Commands. We bind Redux Observables Epics to Lumino Signals. Those bindings convert Lumino Signals to Observable to run the needed actions in the [Observable Epics](https://redux-observable.js.org/docs/basics/Epics.html).

- Services to connect to kernels.
- Extension injection system.
- Lumino signals and messages integrated with Redux.
- Lumino commands.

Jupyter React components removes the above second limitation and supports:

- Predefined Redux actions, epics and reducers with [Observable Epics](https://redux-observable.js.org/docs/basics/Epics.html)
- Everything is created in a single React tree to ensure Jupyter React components can use any context created by the host application.
- IpyWidgets and Panel interactive widgets are supported.
- Collaborative RTC is also supported.
- Plays nice with Jupyter Auth, Jupyterpool, Primer React, Material-UI , Storybook, Docusaurus, Emotion.js... and many other standard libraries.
- A React.js context for Authentication, Authorization, Theming and Redux injectable store.
- Benefits from current and new JupyterLab development, eg edit mode navigation, colored-collapser, collaborative cursor.
- Authentication via Jupyter tokens.
- Theming.
- Terminals.

Jupyter React ensure React.js is a first-class citizen in the Jupyter:

- [Components](/docs/category/components): JupyterLab visual as React.js components
- [Integrations](/docs/category/integrations): Embed Jupyter in Docusaurus.
- [Themes](/docs/category/themes): Themes for your data analysis.

You can get kick-started with simple [examples](/docs/category/examples)

Jupyter React allows you to build a better Jupyter experience. It adds value to the current existing ecosystem, by alphabetical order:

- [x] Accessible.
- [x] Collaborative.
- [x] Performant.
- [x] Reproducible.
- [x] Reusable.
- [x] Scalable.
- [x] Secured.
- [x] Shareable.
