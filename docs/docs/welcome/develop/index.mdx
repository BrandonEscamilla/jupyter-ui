# Develop

Follow the below steps to use and develop Jupyter UI.

## Environment

First, you need [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) up-and-running on your machine.

:::caution

You need to develop on MacOS or Linux. Windows is not supported as development platform for the time-being).

:::

Clone the `jupyter-ui` repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/datalayer/jupyter-ui.git && \
  cd jupyter-ui
```

If you already created a conda environment, please remove it.

```bash
conda deactivate && \
  make env-rm
```

Create a new conda environment.

```bash
make env && \
  conda activate datalayer
```

:::caution

JupyterLab has migrated to Yarn v3 which is not friendly with resolutions, especially for non final (alpha, beta, rc) releases. Ensure Yarn v1 for resolutions and Visual Studio Code completions.

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/v4.0.0a36/jupyterlab/staging/yarn.js \
 -o $( dirname "$(which jupyter)" )/../lib/python3.11/site-packages/jupyterlab/staging/yarn.js
jlpm --version # Should be 1.22.19.
```

## Install and Build

Install the dependencies. This will take some time, be patient. üëç

```bash
make install
```

Build the source code. This will also take some time, be also patient. üôÇ

```bash
make build
```

## Examples

Now you can start an example and hack the source code. The changes will build automatically and will be available in your browser. You will have to accept to SSL certificate in your browser the first time.

```bash
echo open https://localhost:3208
yarn start
```

We have more examples. Pick one of the following commands and enjoy.

```bash
yarn jupyter:example:cra                   # open http://localhost:3000
yarn jupyter:example:lexical               # open http://localhost:3208
yarn jupyter:example:docusaurus            # open http://localhost:3000/docs/intro
```

We also have some uncomplete or deprecated examples...

```bash
yarn jupyter:example:slate                 # open http://localhost:3266
yarn jupyter:example:prosemirror           # open http://localhost:4567
```

## JupyterLab Extension

Jupyter UI can also be shipped as a JupyterLab extension.

```bash
pip install -e .[test]
jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite
jupyter labextension list
jupyter server extension list
yarn jupyterlab
```
